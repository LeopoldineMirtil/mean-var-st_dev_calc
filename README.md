# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This project was completed as part of the freeCodeCamp *"Data Analysis with Python"* course and uses their Gitpod starter code. The instructions for this project can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator).

The aim of the project was to create a function named calculate() that takes a list of 9 digits (from 0-9) as input, converts it into a 3x3 Numpy array and then returns a dictionary containing the values of the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum values along both axes and for the flattened matrix. Users will input the list when calling the function ex. calculate([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]).
